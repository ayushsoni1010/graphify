## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with Graphify, follow the installation and usage instructions in the project's documentation.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushsoni1010/graphify.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd graphify
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables as needed.

4. Start the backend application:
```bash
npm run start
```

5. Change the directory to `frontend` and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

6. Available Scripts in the project directory are given in next steps and this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

7. Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
```bash
npm start
```

8. Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
```bash
npm test
```

9. Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed.
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
```bash
npm run build
```

10. If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

    Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

    You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

## Learn More 💡
